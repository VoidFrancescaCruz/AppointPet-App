# AppointPet Mobile App

  AppointPet is a mobile application that provides an efficient veterinary clinic booking system, making it easier for pet owners to schedule an appointment to a clinic of their own choice. 
  Through the application, users are able to browse through a wide-array of services of clinics in partnership with the application, scan the available dates for making appointments, 
  receive notifications of receipt and booking process, and an e-mail for the reminder of scheduled appointments.
